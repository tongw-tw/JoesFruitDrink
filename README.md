A sequence can be created by squaring a value, dividing by 3 and including that value in the sequence if resulting calculations’ first decimal place is odd. For example, 12/8=0.125 and 1 is odd, so 1 is included in the sequence. Two is included, because 22/8=0.5 and the first fractional digit, 5, is odd. Three is included, because 32/8=1.125. Four is not included because 42/8=2.0 and the first decimal digit, 0, is even.
Create an application allows the user to input the initial positive integer value of the sequence (0-50) and the maximum value for the sequence (range 0-500). The application should display the resulting sequence in a ListBox control when a ‘Begin’ button is clicked. The application should save the initial conditions provided by the user and the resulting sequence to a file when the user clicks a ‘To File’ button.
